**`Hobby Coder / 3D Artist`**

Hi there! 👋
I'm Jonathan, a self-taught hobby developer and 3D artist. Currently, I'm on a journey to teach myself both coding and 3D design,
with a focus on diving deep into the world of programming. My projects stem from a passion for solving real-life challenges I encounter
in my everyday life. I aspire to one day work in the field of programming, turning my self-taught skills into a fulfilling career.
